//Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.
/* Example:
Given the input 701:

Iterative Approach:

First iteration: remainder = 24, quotient = 26; result = ["Y"]
Second iteration: remainder = 25, quotient = 0; result = ["Y", "Z"]
No further iterations since quotient is now 0; final result = "ZY" */

class Solution:
    def convertToTitle(self, columnNumber: int) -> str:
        result = ""

        while columnNumber > 0:
            columnNumber -= 1

            curChar = chr(ord('A') + columnNumber % 26)
            result = curChar + result
            columnNumber //= 26; 
        
        return result
